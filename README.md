# GuessNumber

This very simple project was done by me during my IT learning bootcamp. It was my idea of improvinng my skills outside of bootcamp in a free time (there were a couple of modules that did not include practical coding to catch a breath and prepare for bigger challenges in future modules). Today I guess I could do it only as part of speedcoding contest to see how fast I will make it from scratch, but then I considered it really big achievement... big enough to ask teacher what he thinks about this cute little thing :)
